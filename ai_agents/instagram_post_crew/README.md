# Instagram Post Crew

A CrewAI multi-agent pipeline that takes a topic or product idea and produces a strategically reasoned Instagram content package. Four specialized agents work sequentially: a Trend Intelligence agent analyzes why specific formats and hooks are performing for the niche, a Copywriter agent generates three caption variants and reasons about which fits best, a Visual Strategist agent produces a trend-grounded image generation prompt, and a Posting Strategist agent recommends a publish time tied to niche audience behavior. Agent reasoning is fully visible in the UI.

## How It Works

1. **Trend Intelligence** searches and scrapes current Instagram content for the topic, analyzes why specific formats are performing, and produces a structured creative brief
2. **Copywriting** uses the brief to generate three caption variants across different angles, reasons about which fits the niche, and selects the strongest one with hashtags
3. **Visual Strategy** produces a detailed image generation prompt grounded in trending aesthetics and color psychology for the topic
4. **Posting Strategy** recommends a publish time with reasoning tied to the specific niche audience behavior
